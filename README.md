# LaneDetector
An OpenCV Lane Detector for dummies in C++.


## Instalation

1. OpenCV  
Make sure you have OpenCV installed. This might be a bit tricky. I think this one worked for me: [https://medium.com/@jaskaranvirdi/setting-up-opencv-and-c-development-environment-in-xcode-b6027728003](https://medium.com/@jaskaranvirdi/setting-up-opencv-and-c-development-environment-in-xcode-b6027728003)

2. Run :)

## Notes

The biggest issue right now is the conversion to bird's eye view. This is more or less a matter od keeping the camera really still and finding a right value for the region of interest. The rest should work pretty solid.
